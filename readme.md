# FlaskFootPred

FlaskFootPred is a simple project originlly created to improve my skills in those tools:

- PiPenv packaging tool
- Flask Framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Celery task queue

The final webapp should be able to show you the upcoming ligue 1 matches and the calculated outcome using a deep learning model that I have already created.
The app should also let you navigate in some of the data use for model training.
